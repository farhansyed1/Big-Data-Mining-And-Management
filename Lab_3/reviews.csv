Mohammedia Shawarma,Sanchita Tripathi,"I ordered a cheese falafel wrap. The wrap had no cheese. The falafel was deep fried in oil that was quite old and I could taste it in every bite which made it quite bad. Apart from that quantity wise it was quite good, but tbh quality matters too.

Would I order again? Not really",2,"51 Reviews , 99 Followers"

Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Furious Abbadi,"Green bawarchi is a most familiar restaurant in Hyderabad. They spread over Hyderabad. You will find any green bawarchi near your area.

Coming to this like all green bawarchi restaurants, they have crowd for taken away customers. We had take many times.

Coming to dine here. It's like any normal restaurant with basic interiors. We have to wait 25-30mins after order something. We had grilled chicken, butter chicken, butter naan, rumali roti and chicken biryani. I like their chutney which comes with chicken. Biryani was nice but little spicy. Roti and butter naan both were fine.

Pocket friendly. We can go with family and friends.

Green Bawarchi Restaurant,Kaushik Padmanaban,"This is the first place I experienced Hyderabadi Biryani. I walked in and ordered a chicken briyani. No big deal. The cost was nearly the same as in Chennai, about 200 bucks (I don't remember exactly, but it was around 200). I was shocked when the waiter came with a big serving of briyani. How big, you ask? Two people could share it easily. The taste was first class. I for one can handle briyani as much as you think, but I was stunned. It isn't the best briyani I've ever tasted, but its my first Hyderabadi Biryani and I loved it. Such a great experience.",5,"11 Reviews , 7 Followers"

Squeeze @ The Lime,Asheesh,"Must read - I went to this place with my friends for buffet lunch. We had two options for welcome drink - one is pineapple and other is grape which were not natural fruit juices they tasted as preservatives, then moving on to soup - manchow soup was good, waiter forget to give us the starter. Served us after we reminding him, we liked crispy baby corn among 3 varieties of starters which he took 10 mints to serve for the second serve when only 10% of the place was occupied. When I asked him mayo dip waiter was giving us the left over part of dip on the table beside. When I asked for chilled water they were saying they don't have, later one of my friend asked the same person he gave us chilled water. All the items which were placed at buffet were cold not even Luke warm.

Squeeze @ The Lime,Kshitindra Jain,"Simply the best place in town for hosting a party specially if you are looking for a pure vegetarian authentic north Indian food. I hosted a lunch party for about 40 adults and 15 kids today and what a memorable experience we had!! It was an important personal occasion for me and I wanted it to be a memory for lifetime and Lime staff (specially the manager, Dinesh) made sure that it happens just that way!. Food was excellent. Starters were plenty and each one of them was outclassing the other one in taste. My guest just kept asking for more and more and Lime staff kept serving them without any fuss!. I just loved their Ajwaini Paneer tikka, corn Manchurian and cottage cheese pizza. Pain puri and dahi puri were good too. And yes, the delicious manchow soup that we opted instead of tomato soup they offered by default. Main course was also matching with the high expectations that starters set. All curries were great in taste, rotis and naan were served hot and whenever one wants. Rice item were also good (didn't try one myself but as told by my guests). They served Jalebi with rabadi and chocolate gulabjamoon as desserts and everyone just loved them.

Would also like to specially mention the courtesy and hospitality shown by each and every member of their serving staff. They were actually requesting my guests to taste everything and were treating my guests and their own! What more I could have asked for. At the end special thanks to Lime manager Dinesh who made sure that we have the experience that we had. I would strongly recommend this place if you want a memory for a very long time.",5,"1 Review , 1 Follower"

Frio Bistro,Monideepa Chakraborty,"Frio Bistro is a little quaint place tucked away somewhere in the crowded area of Gachibowli.
The decor was very pretty and the place looked very cosy.
We had non-veg pizza and chicken wings for starters. Both were equally good. The highlight of our meal was pork ribs which was served with veggies and mashed potato. The pork was soft and succulent and melted instantly in our mouth. One could easily say that was prime moment of our dine at Frio Bistro.
Desserts were good as well, but could have been better.
Overall, it‚Äôs a nice place to visit if you want to have a comfortable meal in the midst of the hustle bustle of this city.
Would definitely go back to this joint for their amazing Pork ribs!",4,"3 Reviews , 6 Followers"
Frio Bistro,Tejaswini Sharma,"Well if atall I am in Gachibowli area in lunch times or dinner times...my mind like a magnet asks me to get into this cozy bistro. Each thin slices of pizza wid toppings of olive oil and chilli flakes is all you need for your mid day motivation.
Have been to this place couple of times and Everytime tried something new in veg. But pizza has been a constant one. The Spanish rice too has a very authentic taste and was in competition to the pizza to give ultimate pleasure to tell taste buds. These two dishes have been my favorite and most recommend tough have tried other dishes as well.
A friendly staff and zomato gold is a value addition to this place.
Review#2 my regular visits to this place made me increase the rating from 4 to 5.
I have been to pizza events where the restaurants where claiming that it's the best pizza in town or money back .
Tough I did claim the money back as I feel the best pizza in town is what you get here.
Zomato gold is always an add on benifit .

Frio Bistro,Soumi Mukherjee,"This place is my go to place for continental food at Gachibowli. The food is absolutely awesome. My recommendations would be Doner kebab, any variant of their thin crust pizza and pork ribs.

The doner kebabs are filled with juicy lamb meat balls and topped with spicy mayo stuffed inside fluffly pita breads with a sude of humus.

In pizza, I love the pigs over a blanket pizza. The pizza crust is super thin and this place serves one of the best wood fire pizzas here.

In mains, the pork ribs just melts in your mouth and the stuffed chicken breast is deliciously with the filling of creamy spinach inside.

In desserts I loved all their creations from the baklava, to cherry chocolate cheese cake and to the old fashioned tiramisu...

I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.

The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food. Didn't expect it to be like this.",3,"67 Reviews , 436 Followers"

Hyper Local,Shreshth Malhotra,"Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)",3,"275 Reviews , 1989 Followers"

Over The Moon Brew Company,Mahathi Natva,"If trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... This place is a must visit . It's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.

Beyond Flavours,Pragya Sarda,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.

Beyond Flavours,Vignesh Rk,"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots.

 The most interesting part is that has an open viewing kitchen where we can see freshly prepared bakery items,tarts and macaroons which will leave you wanting for more . Plus great Hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staff.I have been here for breakfast and had English paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte. The quality of bread used is really one of the best.

There were two sizes, small (Rs:160/-) and regular (rs:250/-). Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two. But No!

Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5

When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.

Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.

Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.

Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.

Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.

Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!

This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.

Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds.

The food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.

Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Moonis Ahmed,"Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. 

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 

Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

Coming to the food
For veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. Not a worthy starters for veg
For non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
Main course...Not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
Only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
Salads were good
Chat items not worthy
Deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding

My all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. It is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. I would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. Delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. Their pizzas are also taste worthy. Despite being a non-vegetarian, I really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings. 

Besides the food, their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday.

Highly recommended if you are in the area near Wipro circle Gachibowli.

With both burger and wrap,they give some wedges and salad complementary.When I ordered then as well as when I went to their restaurant,the wedges were cold and dry and they were disgusting.I can understand if it was only in the case when I ordered food but how can the restaurant give the customer who have come for dining already prepared wedges.That was seriously not expected from Deli 9 Bistro!!!",3,"179 Reviews , 1877 Followers"

Desserts were not so great and not many. Felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark.

Thats about the appearance and appeal. Spread was decent for a discounted price of 400 per person inclusive of all taxes, food was ok as well.

Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,The Greedy Hippo,"This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd.

The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space. It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.

Upon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. We were asked if we are here for buffet. The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. I had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.

The manager at this place was a nice fellow. Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. After a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.

I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.

The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.

Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. Simply put, it was a disaster. The curry was as bland as it could be. Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. It was just sitting there doing nothing. Neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. It was going nowhere.

The problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. They say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. I am not a fan of multi cuisine. When you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population.

One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu. They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.

Had the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.

The restaurant needs to find its footing. The owners need to decide which way they want to go. Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine.

I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.

But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.

After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing.

In my case they were quick enough to deliver it in only 1 hour 30 minutes... So fast da.. then I remembered food should have been delivered only in 40 minutes... I asked delivery person why so much late da.. He said sir we were cooking your roll property that's why it took time.. open it and try it sir.. you would have never seen such roll..

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Aparajita Chowdhury,"We went on a weekend to this place as we had been wanting to try out this new place in town for a while.

Starting of with the pros, the decor and ambiance of this place is really good. The menu is quite interesting too, and includes a variety of chicken, pork, beef and some fish dishes. There are a few vegetarian options, but I do not know to what extent it would satisfy a vegetarian. They have a good choice of mocktails as well, and each one was really good. The pork ribs and the mushrooms were good too. The staff there was good too.

Moving on to why I chose to give this a bad review- first of all, the service was really slow. Took about an hour for my food to arrive. Moreover, my chicken noodles tasted exactly like Maggie with a few chicken pieces thrown in. I had attached a picture of it for reference. Moreover the portion sizes are quite small in relation to the price of the dishes. A small bowl of beef curry was 200 and one plate of steamed rice was not even enough for two people. Even though the taste was good, because of the portion sizes and the relative prices plus the service time our experience was ruined.

The staff isn't good at recommending dishes. The Beef curry with Naga chilli isn't good, probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste. The pork belly was good. Beef fry wasn't great because meat was undercooked. The steam country chicken curry was good.

I would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because I really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now.",3,"11 Reviews , 80 Followers"

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Pori Goswami,"This has to be one of my favorite restaurant. It is a tiny, cosy place that serves korean and northeastern food. I am reviewing it for the second time and how much I appreciate this place being a korean food fan in Hyderabad where options are little less in terms of getting Korean/NE cuisine. The owner is super friendly and courteous. The kimbap is good in taste, serves 10 pieces per plate which is worth the money (180bucks) accompanied by wasabi and soya sauce. Just because of kimbap, I can rate this place a 4 happily.",4,"6 Reviews , 46 Followers"
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sourav Ghosh,"This tiny joint serves excellent Northeastern & East Asian food. Their Beef Curry with Naga Peppers is heavenly. Deojikalbi was excellent as well. The Beef Soba Noddles was also good, though less so than the other two items. The portion sizes are a little small, but then again the prices are pretty damn cheap as well. The one area where they can improve is the speed & efficiency of service, but since it's fairly new & has a very small staff at this point (possibly family run ?), I'm optimistic that they will improve as they mature.",5,"63 Reviews , 53 Followers"

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Akshay Krishna,"As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.

Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.

It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.

Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.

Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.

If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures

After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.",1,"144 Reviews , 911 Followers"
Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Anu,I am a big soup fan and both hot and sour and tomato soup was disappointing. The starter was too paste like in the mouth. The garlic naan was amazing.

Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sourav Datta,"Great ambiance with very poor service.

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves.",3,"78 Reviews , 1612 Followers"

Ordered Long Island Ice tea which was perfectly mixed and Margarita was Awesome. They served the buffet on the table while we were having our drinks. They checked with us every 20 minutes to make sure we had a good time and TASTY food. Lastly they bought a cake for my wife to celebrate her birthday.

Aromas@11SIX,Deepank Joshi,"I did not like this place at all. This restaurant do not match zomato gold standards. First thing , the price and ambience do not match at all. This place looks like a shady dhaba from highway but prices for food compares to ohris restaurants.

Even if we ignore prices , taste and services are worst that I have encountered in any Zomato Gold restaurant.

Aromas@11SIX,Priyank Almal,"This place is located in khajaguda. It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste, quantity and pricing. I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week.

Food is no doubt good..their soups, starters dal makhani, etc.. However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.

Prices have been almost doubled . I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ? I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience.. Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience..

With hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..

Hope the management would rethink..",3,"7 Reviews , 6 Followers"

Aromas@11SIX,Rupam Saha,"The ambience was good. We 12 ppl went there for dinner. Some of us ordered biriyani, some had kulcha nun with Kadai murg. For starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks. Starter was delicious but they didn't provide salad and sufficient chatney. For biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed. They told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes. But the rice was sour. With biriyani the gravy they provided didn't have any salt. May b they tried to compensate. One of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 Rs.
And about the service, it was good till we pay the bill.

The Glass Onion,Jay Mehta,"2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience

Lets start with the good part for which the two stars.

Ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.

Thats it to the place and good part!

Service was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.

We did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.

We ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.

Pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.

The platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.

Tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

Cheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.

They gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!

Overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks. Hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar.",2,"46 Reviews , 43 Followers"

There is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place. We chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather.

There is quite a large selection of food from Italian, continental to Indian. We ordered for some starters from which we really like Bakchoy fry and also Malai Broccoli, chilli potato and Red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup I would definitely suggest hi for Broccoli soup. For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.

We had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it‚Äôs really not that expensive and it‚Äôs totally worth it for the view and for the food.

eat.fit,Afreen Jahan,Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.,2,"60 Reviews , 16 Followers"

Well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks.

So i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their Chicken Keem Paratha Wrap. Its was oily and tasted ok, not bad at all. It tasted just  like a regular keema wrap bus.

Yes it came with sugar/ honey coated peanuts and some green chutney, am not sure how it makes up the diet fit. But yes, a nice concept though!",3,"139 Reviews , 685 Followers"

However, 2 days back when I ordered the food, it tasted the same but it had a peculiar smell which has never been there. I took two bites and just left it, those bites created a havoc for me the entire night. It left me with a very bad stomach pain I've never experienced before. Honestly I didn't even expect that it would create such a mess. People always say, avoid street side food which are close to vehicles and all, but this place never disappointed me except for this particular order. So I guess never risking my stomach again.

Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time.

Asking 9 customers to get lost?? We were unhappy with the server's response, and wanted to talk to the manager, who was even worse.

First thing we got was Chicken Tangdi and what I instantly noticed was that it was deep fried, which is not a norm and wasn‚Äôt juicy; all we could taste was charcoal. This made our expectations very low.

In the mean time, I asked them to get the Coke I ordered; it wasn‚Äôt chilled. Hence, I requested them to get Ice. To my surprise, they had no ice.

Coming to the food, it's nothing extraordinary except the fact that the taste is close to home made food. But again, the usage of oil is much more. Biryani and tandoori are the safest options here. Keep a track of what you are ordering because the bill might not come right. Check it before paying. I found a dish added in the bill which I did not order. When pointed out, the waiter seemed to be confused.

This place, if it has a target of surviving,needs to improve a lot in terms of food taste, consistency, service and most importantly, hygiene.",2,"685 Reviews , 794 Followers"

"3B's - Buddies, Bar & Barbecue",Bala Krishna,"Not worth it at all. Paid 500‚Çπ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place

The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience.

Now food - Jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. Fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. Nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. Desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, I thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. So try and rate yourself.

The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.

American Wild Wings,Ritwika Dash,"So on my latest visit to this amazing American themed place, i had an amazing experience. We kinda experienced great fusion of foods running inside the restaurant. There were desi and videshi khaana both.
We started off with the forte of this place ,WINGS. We had texas bbq chicken wings, amazon wild chicken wings, and pattaya thai chicken wings. I personally loved the texas bbq chicken wings. Chicken was rightly done in every single dish. Preparations were spicy enough for all the spice lovers out there. The only complain we had were about the excessive sauces used while serving wings which was lateron rectified.
There were varieties of sauces to choose from to season your wings‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
.
Coming to the salad , i personally felt the caesar salad needs good seasoning otherwise it was good with the grilled chicken chunks ‚ù§Ô∏è
.
The fried chicken burger was just sooo yummy. It was an instant favorite.
.
Kuch desi khaana we had in there were Gongura chicken and dum biryani combo. Shocked? Well hum bhi hue the. But lemme tell you it was a delightful combo , gongura chicken being the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è A must try.
.
.
Some snacks we had in there were Chicken popcorn and nuggets which were great too. The nuggets had good amount of masala powder sprinkled which was like cherry on the top. üòç The popcorn would be great if were bit on the softer side. Otherwise the whole menu for the day was sorted .

American Wild Wings,Anvith Devulapally,"We happened to visit American Wild Wings on a Friday evening and the place was desolated. The place is tidy and can have a better ambiance keeping in view their concept.

We started with a lemon mojito. Though refreshing, it was a tad too sweet for my liking. We thought salad would be a good start but unfortunately, our Chicken Ceasar salad was drenched in dressing. It almost tasted like we ate the lettuce with the sauce and not otherwise.

Then came in an array of wings, each with their own signature sauces. We tried 9 different sauces and liked most of them. All the wings were fried well and had a good crunch. Of all the sauces, my top picks were there barbeque, konaseema amd mexican jerk. Barbeque had a perfect sweet to tang ratio, the konaseema had a nice curry spice flavor with hints of pepper, coriander and coconut, and the Mexican jerk had a garlicky peri-peri kind of flavor. Must try sauces! While these sauces were good, few sauces like the lemon garlic and original hot were disappointing. The lemon garlic was doused with oil and it was floating around in our plate. The original hot didn't taste of anything but spice and bitterness. They also have a sauce names Atomic - the hottest on their menu. It was indeed very hot for my liking. We also tried a drumstick in atomic sauce and it was decent. Chicken nuggets were good. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Though their USP is wings, they succumbed to peer pressure and started serving Biryanis, fried rice and a few curries. We tried their chicken fry-piece biryani and it had a unique flavor. The meat was cooked well amd the level of spice was apt, but the bottom half of the biryani was an oil well. Chicken Punjabi, a sarson ka saag version was actually really good. It had the perfect saag flavor. Again, too oily.

Upon their suggestion, we tried their pasta in white sauce and chicken popcorn, both of which were terrible. The pasta was rancid and the popcorn felt like chewing on cardboard. Stay away!

Another thing we noticed was the temperature of the dishes. The first serving of our wings was dead cold. When brought to their notice, the second serving was mouth-burning hot. The biryani seemed like it was heated in the serving bowl. The bowl was so hot, we couldn't even pick it to put the food in our plates.

Overall, they do have potential but have a lot of areas to improve. The quality of wings and sauces is good but the other areas like the usage of oil in dishes, serving temperature and the freshness of ingredients needs to be worked upon. They also need to quickly improve on the ambiance and vibe of the place to attract crowds. Price wise, they are pretty pocket friendly!

American Wild Wings,Salwa Rahman,"American Wild Wings is a very affordable place which serves quality wings. Located in Gachibowli main road, just beside creamstone, it is a place to relish Chicken Wings.

I tried out their Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Salad, Chicken Fried Burger and Various Chicken Wings. The sauce I loved the most was BBQ Chicken Wings. Chicken Nuggets were amazing as well.

We tried their Lemonade and Mango Mojito, they were okay but can be improved. The service by Mr Srinivas is quick and he is very understanding. Ambience needs a bit of touch up here and there especially at the entrance.

This place is a must try for their Wings and Nuggets.",5,"3 Reviews , 1 Follower"
American Wild Wings,Vamshi Puli,"I absolutely love chicken wings so I had to try this new place in Gachibowli as I‚Äôve heard about it from a few friends.

I‚Äôve been to this place with a group of foodie friends.
This is a small outlet located on the first floor ,right above dirty burgers.
The place can host upto 30 pax max.
The place was bright and colourful with good lights all over the place.



Food:
We tried different sauces:
The Texas bbq ,spicy garlic ,Pattaya Thai ,original hot ,Mexican jerk and Amazon wild.
All of the wings were delicious and had varying spiciness.
The wings were slightly crispy outside and soft inside,just the way I like them to be.

Next we were served with chicken nuggets and chicken popcorn.
The best munching dish I love till date are the chicken nuggets.
They tasted really good and were tastier than expected.
The nuggets were my favourite.

The chicken popcorn was not that great.
The presentation was not at all good and the chicken was very chewy.
Need to improve this.

Surprisingly the menu had biryani in it.
We tried their wings dim biryani .
The biryani was not that proper Hyderabadi biryani but had a good taste .
They served a really good quantity of biryani.

The management has to improve in their food presentations.
I personally liked this place and recommend everyone to do give it a try.",4,"59 Reviews , 611 Followers"
American Wild Wings,Raj Kumar,"Hello Hyderabad..!!!!!My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the  awesome food court around Hitech City and Gachibowli. it is  located near the DLF signals and beside Creamstone Gachibowli above Thick Shakes. 
The ambiance is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.

The menu design with array spans of Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Red hot roasted Chicken Wings  ‚ù§Ô∏è - Juicy chicken wings are coated and fried along with Mexican                                                                   Jerk Suces Yummy unforgettable. 

Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.

Drum Stick Dum Biryani-
OMG very different as i never experienced trust me  you guys will fall in love with it. 
Drum Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Nachos topped with red sauce and I JUST  loved it.  
Combos ‚ù§Ô∏è - The true fact i have ever seen even in KFC, Mc-Donald's such awesome combi within a convincing budget. loved it. 

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out all kinds biryanis so far The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mock-tails. Sluches chocolate flav is an absolute delight! Also a fan of coke float.

The staff is ever so courteous. Awesome place to hangout with friends it really fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!!!!!",5,"1 Review , 2 Followers"

Tempteys,Siva Kumar,"Drinks(4.5/5)- I think Tempteys and MOM rule the shakes world in terms of multiple outlets on Hyderabad.
Look out for little app/nearbuy for offers .
Shakes are good, chilly and refreshing.
My personal favorite being Oreo Shake.

Ambience-(3.5/5) The place is cool, can hangout and can have quality talk, as it is mostly empty and most orders generally are take aways.

One thing, they should at least keep the tables CLEAN. There were so many dead flies and insects on the tables which would bring disgust.

Service-(4/5) They know their work, prepare the shakes well. One suggestion is to provide water to the customers, as it seems ridiculous that you deny with the fact that you guys don't have water.

Tempteys,Sugandha Saxena,"Tempteys recently revamped their menu, and we got a chance to try the additions at their Gachibowli outlet. This outlet is a mere walking distance away from DLF, and easily locatable in the building next to Vijaya Bank.

All their shakes come with the options of 2 bases Gelato (icecream) and Avalanche (yoghurt). Here's a list of the new ones, and how they fared.

Poppy corn: It looks quite plain, but one sip, and you'll be amazed at the smoky flavour of popcorn hitting you from the sweet shake.
Merry cherry and Crunchy Forest Berry are for those who love the berries.
If you're a Mint enthusiast, do try the Mint o Fruit shake.
For those who can't get enough of cookie shakes, Cookie Feast comes in with Oreo and Little Hearts stacked on the top.
Coffee addicts can try the very appealing Coffee Hazelnut, which was absolutely a pretty sight too!
My personal favourite, though, was Caramel Brownie. The flavour of caramel, with chewy chunks of brownie, and a topping of whipped cream üòç heavenly!
Another good one was the Cheese Cake shake. It felt like a fruit cake, blended into a shake, and is good if you enjoy that flavour.
There's a whole set of flavours of slushies as well.

Just in case, it gets too sweet, they have French Fries and Potato Wedges, available in a total of 8 flavours. They come in cute little boxes, that you can probably carry away too! We tried and absolutely loved the Chilli Garlic, Real White cheese, and Cajun Spice flavours.
At 89 bucks, they're quite good to be honest.
Do give them a try whenever you're around!

Barbeque Nation,Sidhant Girglani,"We were here to give our treat to a group of friends. What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad.",1,"22 Reviews , 17 Followers"

T Grill,Sudheer Reddy,"Firstly this restaurant is very untidy and noisy. The ambiance was the worst and it is crowded and untidy place. So couples who want to have a good time please stay away.

However the food was ok. You can visit this restaurant once to just have a taste of the dishes. I still wonder why most people prefer t-grill despite all its negatives. üëé

T Grill,Trishna M,"Ordered a nice dinner for two from T Grill. The prices are mediocre and I placed my order late night via Uber Eats. Following is my experience-:

Service- The parcel came in around 10 minutes later than estimated. The delivery boy called once he was outside our society. 3/5

Presentation/Packaging- It was a usual packing. Nothing extraordinary nor anything bad about it. 3/5

Food- Food was fine but what really killed my appetite for it was the amount of chillies added. We tried the following-:

Paneer Pulao- It had a nice quantity, sufficient for two. There were average number of paneer pieces. It tasted quite yum. The masala was ample inside. Too spicy which killed it's essence. 3.5/5

Gobi 65- A good quantity for two, it tasted like a typical fried Gobi. Nothing extraordinary, the usual. 3/5

Will I order from here again? I will only if they decrease the spice level. Despite mentioning it clearly as an extra special instruction, it was supremely spicy which made me fill my stomach with water.",3,"316 Reviews , 1156 Followers"

Food here is just average not great. Service need to be improved a bit. We were there waiting to order but no one turned to take the order. Ordered veg Manchuria, appollo fish, kaju paneer ,kulcha. All of them very ok but not great.",4,"24 Reviews , 18 Followers"

T Grill,Arpita Sarkar,Worst experience in sense of service. We came to this place group of 9 people. They were taking forever to take the orders. We received piece of hair in one of the starter. We had to seek the people to take our orders. Quantity of all the starters was very less. Every time we needed to ask them to serve. They were leaving the starters just like that on table. All the dishes were average or can rate them below than that as well. None of them was extraordinary. Waiting for main course was more than 30 mins.,2,"2 Reviews , 2 Followers"
T Grill,Raghunatha Reddy Ontikommu,"On the way back home from Mrugavani National Park, had a stop here for lunch. I really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing. First impression, no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it, all were parked zigzag, welcomed by foul odour at that point.
Huge place, but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further, like where to sit or dine, especially if it was first time like me. Initially noticed an outdoor seating, organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables. Felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn't make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors, also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread. No one cared to guide until I personally asked of any indoor is available.
So shifted to inside dining room, great relief finding at a corner a place for us. Our order was Veg platter - not worth price, taste, quantity. Jumbo chicken Biryani - evenly cooked, tender chicken, not so flavorful, Mutton Biryani is good.
Service lag, may be of huge rush. Missing fine dine features, asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside.
Village back drop artifact, greenery are little bit saviors. May be at evening hours, outdoor seating could be good choice. Anyway no thrill at T grill.",3,"104 Reviews , 2833 Followers"

Pista House,Ganesh Suriyanarayanan,"Went there for lunch with friends, and not a good dining experience.
1.  Ambience - not like a Fine Dine restaurant - more a quick eatery / Cafeteria place
2.  Service  : Ok.  the person who took the order did promptly mention how much time a dish will take to be served, it is good to be prepared
3.  Food : OK to Pathetic.  we had some starters Paneer Tikka was good and other ones were ok and from my friends who had Tandoori Prawns their Opinion was not so good.  After the starters the Disaster came in the name of EGG Biriyani.  We had ordered for 2 Egg biriyani,  there was no Flavour, gravy or taste in that, it is just a coloured biriyani rice with Fried Boiled Eggs. See the Photo.  It didnt end here, we gave a feedback the Waiter promptly took the bowl back to get some masala in it, and came back and served with masala which was Chicken pieces. Two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates.  

We ended up not eating that second bowl of biriyani except for few spoonful, we were charged for that biriyani, after some discussion they reduced the  price of 1 biriyani from our bill.

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Yogesh Kumar Gupta,"We went for a lunch with our team, and all of us were truly disappointed with the food and the service as well. For vegans, they had just 2 starters.. the food did not had any taste, it was more like just things being mixed without any skills. Desserts were little better, but main course was completely disappointing, be it the dal makhani, which lacked consistency, or the paneer, which was like cubes poured on top of the gravy. I certainly would have tasted better food than this at pretty lower costs.",1,"16 Reviews , 46 Followers"

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Amit,"Standing true to its 5-star ambience, the food gels to fit in the category of a premium outing. Salads, Chat, North Indian, Continental to South Indian, this place tends to fulfil the cravings of each category. There was a huge section of Salads out of which Bacon salad being the pick of the lot. The Starters spread included Hummus varieties with dry and soft pita breads, Farm fresh cheese varieties which were a delight, Live chat and Pasta counters, Tawa fish, Fish fry, Chicken starters, Pork pepperoni, Sauted mushrooms, Chicken Salami, Bacon, Sausages etc.  

The Main course had Chicken Haleem which was okaish, Chicken Biryani which was good, Mutton curry where I felt the pieces were undercooked, Mirchi ka salan, Veg Biryani and some veg curries. The main course could have been better in terms of the standard of taste set by the starters. Prawns and Crab items were missing which could have furthermore enhanced the visit experience. The desserts section was an absolute joy for sweeth tooth. They had a humungous spread of sweets which included Chocolate burfi sandwich, mud pudding, motichoor laddu, Barfis, Moong dal Halwa, Phirni, Fruit kheer etc. The pastries section had a lot to offer in terms of various flavours and varieties.

Feast - Sheraton Hyderabad Hotel,Saurabh Verma,"Yesterday, as always I went out for family dinner. We wanted to try something new. My wife searched for a highly rated restaurant and found this restaurant on Google. As I'm Sheraton/ Marriot Platinum member (42216744521/791050313) and had the best experience in past, I thought this would be a good choice. We booked the table. We started the food but soon we realized that we have made the worst decision of our life ever for restaurant selection. We opted to go with Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but the food was cold, not even warm. I did not like the food much. It was not even okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Only real-time cooked food was hot like pasta, roti. Anyway, we finished our food and came back. Now in the night, my younger son started vomiting and he was finding difficulties to digest water as well. The whole night he was vomiting. And, in the morning my wife stared do vomiting. We rushed to the hospital [Continatal] and the doctor clearly said it is food poising. We went to flashback and realized my wife and younger son had come vegetable team, which may have caused the vomiting. Eldor son had pasta so he was good.

The Food, ambiance, service is exceptionally good but what really stands out is their beers.

The liquor section Of Tilt is hands down the most rare one, I say this cause of the beers they offer. I am not a beer person but here the beers are like nothing I've had before.

The beers are imported from different parts of the world and specially from those areas cause you wouldn't get the taste elsewhere.

We ordered Mutton Galouti Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kadhai, Butter chicken, Dal Tadka, Tandoori Rotis and Jeera Rice. The Mutton Kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

The veg seekh Kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the Mutton, but still held a good taste. The star for us was the Butter chicken. Slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. I was bowled over..! So impressed was I, that the Paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! The Dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that Butter chicken. The only less impressive dish among the lot was the Jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

In all, a very good experience. I cant say Value for money, but the food was impressive in general. Worth more visits, any day..! Thanks.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Gaurav,"Would you like to feast on North Indian food in Hyderabad? Are you a foodie or die hard fan of butter chicken? Go or order from NorFest, I was deffinitely vow after having sambhar or idli for couple of days when I ordered from this place. Big fan of them, tried their all outlet and I must say good pricing with awesome taste (Without curry leaves :)))) in Hyderabad (No Offence to south indian  food).

NorFest - The Dhaba,Roohi Najiya,"‚ö´Ô∏è This has to be my favourite Punjabi restaurant in Hyderabad!!! During my short trip in Hyderabad,I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!
The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy üíÉüíÉ
So, we ended up in this restaurant!! It is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!
.
.
üî¥We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:
‚Çπ269/-
It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It comprises of the following:
‚ñ™Ô∏èKadai Paneer (4.5/5)
Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravyüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èDum aloo (4/5)
This was the veg of the day, potatoes ü•î were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èDal Makhani (4.5/5)
A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èBundi Raita (5/5)
This one stole my heart ‚ù£ I think words won‚Äôt do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish üëçüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èRice (4/5)
The zeera basmati rice üçö was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èButter Tandoori Roti (4/5)
It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat üåæ without any hint of maida!!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èSalad (4.5/5)
Fresh cucumber ü•í, carrot ü•ï and onion with a pinch of lemon üçã is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali üëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èKheer (4/5)
The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
‚ö´Ô∏è The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Cascade - Radisson Hyderabad Hitec City,Dinesh Rajagiri,"An evening in THE Radisson itself is one it's kind. And when the food is unlimited, it's just bliss - a heaven on earth.

We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality, variety of dishes and a great ambience. But somehow, we don't know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it. It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that, we don't know.

When I retrospect back home, I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there. Not that they were rude but they didn't care much. The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us.

Well, coming to the dishes, we had a nice sumptuous dinner. The best part was the dessert section. If had a variety of spreads. It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes.
Oh, boy! I had a ball.

Had the staff had been a little attentive, I'd have rated an easy 4.0! I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy. But we've been too many 5-star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently.

First of all , all the menu in the buffet were cold, i felt like i am eating a day before's food. Not at all fresh. You will find lots and lots of varities in buffet, but when it comes to taste, disappointed. It was completely waste of money. Services and hospitality was somewhat good.

They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Ramakanta Mohanty,"(Vegetarian Review on Lunch Buffet)
Pros.....
Great service
Starter and Deserts are the winner here.... satisfied.
Spacious and comfortable.
Main course is.....I can say not bad.

Cons...
Asked for Nan and we got it when we already finished our lunch.
Ice-cream not available. I have asked there but the guy told me there is no ice-cream available. I got to know from my colleague that they serve ice cream on demand. This is wired.

Thank You for your service.",4,"12 Reviews , 20 Followers"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,John Nikheth Chiluvuri,"It was on my birthday I visted this place.
Ambience, service and location of this place is spot on..
Choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly. Right balance of Indian, Chinese, etc
We ordered a Chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy, succulent and fresh.
Chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. Noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :D You won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
Tried sushi for the first time.. It was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :D forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. LOL..
We ordered 2 mocktails as well which were not there in the menu, suggested by waiter.. both of them tasted good.. :) waiters could have been more attentive other than that no complaints..
Overall it was a nice dinner on an occasion of birthday..",5,"7 Reviews , 477 Followers"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rajjit Das,"I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for √† la carte. I was among the two who went for √† la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.
Coming to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the √† la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of saut√©d spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.
Overall, it's a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world.",4,"17 Reviews , 399 Followers"
Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Anshita,"After hearing from friends, we planned to visit this place on a Sunday.
Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

La La Land - Bar & Kitchen,Vasu Deva Reddy,"This is my regular hangout place with my office buddies. The food was good thats the only reason for these 2 stars. But this review I'm writing is after a worst experience in this place. Last friday we have been to this place and we were looking at menu. my friend asked for a drink but floor manager said they don't have that brand. Then he asked for another brand again same reply. Then we looked at food menu and ordered chicken lolly pop then floor manager angrily said this is not local bar to ask everything whatever u eat outside. Then we literally got angry and said this is in your menu that's the only reason we are asking for it. Then he kept mum. We were literally pissed off by that floor manager behaviour and decided not to visit that place again.
Management need to take action against that floor manager or else they will lose some more regular visitors in future.",2,"16 Reviews , 32 Followers"

Very limited options for starter - 3 non-veg(2 chicken and 1 fish) and 3 veg(2 potato and 1 paneer). they were serving the starter cold. The tawa fish was over spicy and they didn't prepare a lesser spicy version of that even after our request. Only chicken wings was good.

Main course was kind of good. Egg fried rice and veg noodles were good. Chicken biriyani was stale.

Dessert was good. Chocolate cake, gulaab jamoon and Ice cream were good. Semiya kheer was horrible.",2,"1 Review , 4 Followers"

This place is known for its rusty garage-like interiors, where you can rent some top notch automobiles. The Cafe in ""Driven Cafe"" is rather disappointing, staff isn't very friendly, nor very observant to details. They ask for extra money for everything even when the coffee costs similar to expensive coffee chains.

Gal Punjab Di,Manasi Puranik,"We ordered Butter chicken, paneer makhani, dal makhani and mango lassi. The gravies had no distinctive flavor. They were overtly sweet and tasted nothing like the original dishes. The dal makhani was tolerable (but not good).

Expected some semblance of authenticity after reading the reviews.",1,"4 Reviews , 35 Followers"

I have always ordered and found them to be good but this time i was disappointed. From the looks of the paratha, i am sorry to say this, but it didn't look very punjabi.

Gal Punjab Di,Anupam Agarwal,"When you love food and especially north Indian food you crave for the perfect butter chicken that you would probably get up north.

I guess I finally seemed to have found it in Hyderabad.

Having been to the best Indian food joints like Grand Trunk, Norfest I guess the Butter Chicken here ranks at the top... Each one of them are good in their own regard though..

I landed up at this place basis my online food orders not through Zomato but through swiggy ( somehow that's an irony given that both deliver the same distance Zomato doesn't deliver from here to my place)

So probably I will not comment on Ambience and Service.. will update that later once I visit the place but food is something that's outstanding

In the last 20 days I would have ordered 3-4 times that's a lot for me given that I don't get fixated to a place as I m more of a food explorer üôÇ.

The food has not disappointed me so far. Items tried so far
Punjabi Butter Chicken - Must Recommend , the best you will find in town
Veg Angara - good
Bhatti kaMurg - must try
Tandoori Momo - can be avoided
Dahi ke kebab - brilliant for vegetarians
Murg Malai Kebab - good
Murg Tikka Masala - must recommend, the best part is that both the gravy's ( of this and butter chicken) are completely different which is hard to find. A person who loves chicken will understand my sentiments
Dal Makhani - must try
Tandoori Murgh - must try

So that pretty much sums up my journey with the restaurant for the past 3 weeks.. it's awesome do try if they deliver to ur place.
